# pygame_platformer
I've been curious about game development since I was a kid, and while this is certainly nothing close to the games I grew up playing, it was a fun foray into the field, and a nice change of pace from what I usually work on in the office. 

# How to launch
Simply download the repo, cd in, and py Game.py

# Known issues
The platforms do not like to let you walk off the side.  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
